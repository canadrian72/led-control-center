# Home LED Control Center

A set of docker-based services which use Raspberry Pis and MQTT to control WS2811 LED strips.

- Quick Kube notes:
  - Must enable metallb load balancing with ` enable metallb:<local_pi_ip:local_pi_ip>`
  - To add a node:
    - ` join 10.0.0.34:25000/378ff66642ed6791ec4bf7fcfa446826/6fdae4403366 --worker`
    - Or:

```
  join 10.0.0.34:25000/378ff66642ed6791ec4bf7fcfa446826/6fdae4403366
  join 2607:fa49:6040:8300::8bb2:25000/378ff66642ed6791ec4bf7fcfa446826/6fdae4403366
  join 2607:fa49:6040:8300:dea6:32ff:feeb:63ef:25000/378ff66642ed6791ec4bf7fcfa446826/6fdae4403366
```

## Repository Structure

- `/IotControlCenterUi`
  - Holds React-Typescript app for user interface
- `/Api`
  - Holds flask API to handle UI calls and publish MQTT messages to IoT devices accordingly
- `/LedController`
  - Holds python service to listen for MQTT events and change LED strip behavior accordingly
- `/BulbController`
  - Holds python service to listen for MQTT events and change TPLink kasa-smart bulb behavior accordingly
- `/SystemdFiles`
  - Systemd service configuration files to allow each microservice to be automatically deployed and updated startup on raspberry pi boot
- `install.sh`
  - Copies Systemd configuration files into `/etc/systemd/systm/` of raspberry pis
  - Makes `start.sh` and `stop.sh` scripts executable

## IotControlCenterUi

- React-Typescript web app hosted with an nginx server
- Docker compose file used to build react app and host on nginx
- All components found in `/src`
- Look of web-page:

* Allows to change LED strip color, brightness, and activate different sequences

## Api

- Flask API to provide endpoints to activate different commands
- After each route is called, MQTT is used to publish this command to the other raspberry pi
  - e.g the LED route publishs an object of type `LedRequest` as a dictionary with options for LED command (i.e. brightness, HSV values, operation)
- Docker compose file used to build dockerfile to host and expose the flask API

## LedController

- Holds code which actually interfaces with LED strip
  - `led_operation.py` contains functions to execute different operations on the LEDs (e.g. rainbow, change brightness, set all pixels as RGB value, etc.)
  - `mqtt_client.py` starts an MQTT client to listen for publish events from flask API
- Docker compose builds docker file to host and expose service on local area network

## SystemdFiles

- Holds configuration files for each service
  - Allows each service to be automatically started on boot

## install.sh

- Each service has a folder called `/ShellScripts`
  - These scripts start and stop the service by calling `docker-compose up ...` or `docker-compose down ...` respectively
- Install .sh makes each shell script executable and moves Systemd files into the root file system

## Hardware
